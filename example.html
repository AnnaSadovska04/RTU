                <b>ygjfkgjgyguyf</b> (July 28, 1958 – June 28, 1981) was a Canadian athlete, humanitarian,
                and
                cancer research activist. In 1980, with one leg having been amputated due to cancer, he embarked on an
                east to west cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research.

                Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and 5,373
                kilometres (3,339 mi), and ultimately cost him his life, his efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide
                legacy
            </p> <!-- 7-->

            <p>The annual Terry Fox Run, first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60
                countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over C$750 million has
                been raised in his name, as of January 2018
